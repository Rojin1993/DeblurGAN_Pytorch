# DeblurGAN_Pytorch
Firstly, create blurred images from high resolution. For this step, simply use the BlurredImages.ipynb file (if you have blurred image just put them in a folder in google colab). Please note that the Blurred folder contains the blurred images. You can change the amount of blurring by changing the value in the parentheses of blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(np.array(img), (9,9), 0), just make sure you choose an odd number. To test this method on blurred images, utilize the DeblurGANimplementation.ipynb file.You can utilize either GAN pretrained weights or WGAN_GP pretrained weights. Simply download the weights from this link "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w-u0r3hd3cfzSjFuvvuYAs9wA-E-B-11" and place them in your Google Drive.
